# basic-ALU
Simulates the ALU we used as an Example in CompSys. Not clean, not pretty, not efficient, not user friendly 

It's a java project that simulates the ALU.
Data is saved using boolean arrays.

Initializes register all 0.
(16 words, 8 bit by default, hardcoded constant at Start.java (-> Issues))
Prints complete register after execution.
Supports instruction set we used in CompSys (Opcode ids [should] be the same as their binary representation in he slides).
Assembly code is read from file, currently hardcoded at Start.java (-> Issues)
